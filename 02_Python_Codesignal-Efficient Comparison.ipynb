    "if L < x ** y <= R:\n",

    "The second option:\n",
    "python\n",
    "if x ** y > L and x ** y <= R:\n",
    "is also efficient and will produce similar performance to the first option, as it involves two comparisons and one arithmetic operation. However, it separates the two comparisons, potentially leading to a slightly slower execution in some cases due to the evaluation of two separate conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third option:\n",
    "python\n",
    "if x ** y in range(L + 1, R + 1):\n",
    "is less efficient compared to the first two options. It creates a range object in memory (potentially with many elements), and then checks if x ** y is in that range. This approach involves more memory usage and additional computational overhead compared to the direct comparisons used in the first two options. Therefore, it is less efficient in terms of execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the first option (if L < x ** y <= R) is the most efficient in terms of execution time, as it directly checks the condition without unnecessary overhead."
